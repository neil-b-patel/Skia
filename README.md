# Skiá
Skiá is a single-player 2D exploration game that leverages the elements, abstract art, meaningful choices, and simple mechanics.
The player is dropped onto a map consumed by darkness and given the ability to move by a mysterious person. 
This person seems to know much more than they let on but they simply tell you to “go explore, learn to be, grow, and find your balance.” 
The world map has four elemental hubs in the cardinal directions and uses a top-down camera. 
On your explorations you encounter obstacles, enemies, and bosses that are either overcome through choices and dialogue options or 2D elemental battles that change the camera to a side-scroller type.
